        <p>By signing below, the client(s) indicate an understanding and agreement to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I understand I have read the above settlement disbursement summary and agree to it.</li>
            <li>If there are multiple law firms listed on the disbursement, the identity of which and distribution of fees has already been disclosed and consented to, in writing, at the inception of the case pursuant to CA Rules of Prof. Conduct 1.5.1, but you are again consenting to this distribution. The fact that multiple law firms have worked on your matter does not increase the total fee.</li>
            <li>I understand that any funds will be issued to the person(s) listed below in the form of a check for payment, which will then be delivered either via U.S. Mail or, where permissible and economical, by overnight delivery.</li>
            <li>The time required for any checks to clear the Client Trust Account is ten (10) business days after deposit.</li>
            <li>I understand that my attorney(s) have compiled a file of notes, attorney work product, correspondence, and other legal documents, collectively referred to as my “legal file.”</li>
            <li>I understand that my legal file will be kept by my attorney(s) for a period of seven (7) years from the date of this disbursement, after which it may be destroyed.</li>
            <li>I understand that my attorney(s) have made no representations about the tax consequences that this settlement/recovery may have and that I should consult with an independent tax advisor, of my own choosing, if I desire any advice about the tax consequences which may result from this settlement.</li>
